# Screenshot Rules (No Leaks)

## OK to show
- VM settings (Hyper-V / VM hardware settings)
- Internal IPs (e.g., 198.51.100.x)
- Lab domain name (e.g., lab.local)

## Avoid showing
- Public IP addresses
- Wi-Fi SSID / router admin pages with identifying info
- Personal email addresses
- License keys, product keys, serial numbers, hardware IDs

## If something sensitive appears
- Blur it (Paint works) OR
- Re-take the screenshot with the sensitive area hidden (preferred)
